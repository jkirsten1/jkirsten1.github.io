My name is Jake Kirsten. I'm a senior at Northern Michigan University studying information security and graduate in December. I developed a passion for cybersecurity after expressing interest in software engineering. At the time a professor at Wayne State University urged me to pursue cybersecurity as a way to compliment the growing software engineering field, and all it took was one networking class to get me hooked. 

## About the blog

I will be documenting my learning process here as I continue to develop my penetration testing skills. I want to come back and understand what I might've done wrong or right! While I believe I developed incredible skills during my time in school, there are some things they just don't teach.
