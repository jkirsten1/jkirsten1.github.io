This was my first ever hackthebox experience. Maybe a Domain Controller wasn't the easiest option there, but it was an excellent learning experience.

### enumeration

Here is my firstnmap result. I will explain later what my mistake was. Nevertheless the first scan gave an indication that it is a domain controller.

```nmap -sV -sS 10.10.10.161```

My initial mistake was not scanning every single port, later on we find out why.

My next plan was to figure out what we can do with the information given to us in the scan. Considering it is a Domain Controller (Windows Server 2016) I googled around for tools and techniques.

This is where I Found impacket. After reading notes, and a couple of hints from HTB forums I decided this was a good place to start.

Notes: [Impacket Notes!](https://www.secureauth.com/labs/open-source-tools/impacket)

You can install it with:

```git clone https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket```

I placed it in a directory I made for this specific lab at `/root/htb/`

After reading through the notes that SecureAuth provides on their tool the best course of action was to enumerate a list of users. Knowing a bit about Windows the script > samrdump.py 	caught my eye.

running it with the basic syntax worked  `sudo ./samrdump.py 10.10.10.161`

### exploiting the user

Now what do we do with this list of users? Honestly I went to the HTB forums for a hint on this one. One user mentioned using 'impacket' for this portion as well, a trend is forming.

After playing around with multiple different scripts and users I came across `GetNPUsers.py`

What exactly does this script do? It attempts to list and get TGTs for users that have the property `UF_DONT_REQUIRE_PREAUTH`
The output is compatible with JtR but I decided to use hashcat instead.

type `sudo ./GetNPUsers.py htb.local/svc-alfresco -dc-ip 10.10.10.161 -k -no-pass -format hashcat`

While I'm unsure if the syntax is entirely correct. Specifically the `dc-ip` portion: this was the output:

![ticket hash]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/HTB/forest/grabticket.png)

Now we just send it through hashcat with `hashcat -m 18200 --force -a 0 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`

We're using 18200 because this is a kerberos hash. 13100 provided no output.

![cracked hash]({{ site.baseurl ]}/images/HTB/forest/crackedhash.png)

Notice the cracked hash gives us the password: `s3rvice` 

It took me a bit of time to figure out what to do with these credentials. I spent a few hours tinkering with the impacket tools and wasn't getting any results. So I took to the forums and asked for a hint.

![help]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/HTB/forest/enumhigher.png)

This prompted me to run a more detailed nmap scan with `nmap -sV -sS -p 1-55000 10.10.10.161`

![Better Nmap]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/HTB/forest/betternmap.png)

My original mistake was not doing a thorough enough nmap scan. Without it I would not have known the port for WinRM was open. I decided to google around for a WinRM shell and came across `Evil-WinRM` on Github.

`git clone https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm` Make sure ruby and the necessary packages are installed.
