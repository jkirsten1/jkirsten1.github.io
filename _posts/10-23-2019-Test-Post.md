# Kerberoasting

## Summary

This was my first ever hackthebox experience. Maybe a Domain Controller wasn't the easiest option there, but it was an excellent learning experience.

### enumeration

Here is my firstnmap result. I will explain later what my mistake was. Nevertheless the first scan gave an indication that it is a domain controller.

'nmap -sV -sS 10.10.10.161'

My initial mistake was not scanning every single port, later on we find out why.

My next plan was to figure out what we can do with the information given to us in the scan. Considering it is a Domain Controller (Windows Server 2016) I googled around for tools and techniques.

This is where I Found impacket. After reading notes, and a couple of hints from HTB forums I decided this was a good place to start.

Notes: [Impacket Notes!](https://www.secureauth.com/labs/open-source-tools/impacket)

You can install it with:
'git clone https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket'

I placed it in a directory I made for this specific lab at '/root/htb/'

After reading through the notes that SecureAuth provides on their tool the best course of action was to enumerate a list of users. Knowing a bit about Windows the script 'samrdump.py' caught my eye.

running it with the basic syntax worked 'sudo ./samrdump.py 10.10.10.161'
