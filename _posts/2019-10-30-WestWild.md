This is an Ubuntu box from [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/westwild-11,338/) and was labelled as an intermediate machine, but leaning on the easier side.

I enumerated the IP address with `Netdiscovery -r 192.168.1.0/24` for my home network and placed it in `/etc/hosts/`

As always we go with the standard nmap scan 

> nmap -sV -sS westwild


![nmap]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/westwild/nmap.png)

There's a few ports open that are noticable: port 22, 80, and 445.

I ran a dirbuster on port 80, but nothing quick came up. We'll circle back here to looking at different extensions such as `.php` if the other paths lead nowhere.

Normally you can use `Enum4Linux` to enumerate a Samba Share, but I went with `smbclient -L westwild` to return a list of shares.

If I had enumerated it properly it would have shown wave allowing a login, but I just tried all of them 1 by 1.

![smbwave]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/westwild/smbwave.png)

Here the first flag was right there in the directory, as well as additional information on how to find the next flag.

To download the flags:
> get FLAG1.txt
> get message_from_aveng.txt

The message I forgot to take a screenshot of, but it stated that wave can help aveng reset their password. Good information for later!

We looked at the flag and it is in base64 format. To read it we run the following command:

> cat FLAG1.txt  |  base64 -d

What this does is pipe the cat results into a base64 decrypter.

![flag1]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/westwild/flag1.png)

Now we have credentials! I remembered earlier that port 22 is open. Which means I was going to try my luck at a login to get a user shell.

![sshwave]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/westwild/sshwave.png)

To my surprise we got a successful login. At this point I'm confident running a  more detailed dirbuster on port 80 is not necessary.

I went online to help me with the next step, which was enumerating what this user is allowed to do. I came accross this page:

![helpwithfiles]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/westwild/helpwithfiles.png)

This tells me some of the options and an example on what I can do with the `find` command.

> find / -writable -type d 2>/dev/null

Note the image before this command. `-d` is for directory and `-writable` is just whether or not it's writeable by the user.

![findwriteable]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/westwild/findwriteable.png)

A secret! let's look there. If this was not there we'd probably look at most of these directories.

we head to the directory with `cd /usr/share/av/westsidesecret/` and there was a file named `ififorget.sh` which is related to that first flag.

> cat ififorget.sh

![avengcreds]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/westwild/avengcreds.png)

More creds! I decided to open a 2nd ssh session rather than logging into the account from this one, and it was successful.

I spent more time than I care to admit on this one. I figured there was another path towards root until I typed in the command `id`

It gave me an output of `1000`. Most linux machines today start at the user id of 1000. It prompted me to run:

>sudo -l

This checks whether or not the user has sudo permissions, since it was the first account made on the host.

![checksudo]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/westwild/checksudoperm.png)

Great! I feel silly because I was spending quite a bit of time looking around. You can login via `sudo su` to escelate to root.

![flag2]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/westwild/flag2.png)

That was easier than anticipated! A bit embarassing that I spent so much time looking in places I did not need to.

Things I learned:

- Enumerate writeable files
- Becoming more comfortable with linux command line (base64 decrypt)
